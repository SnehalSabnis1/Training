1. Factorial Function

#pseudocode

function factorial(n)
    if n == 0
        return 1
    else
        result = 1
    for i from 1 to n
        result = result * i
        return result

this function calculates the factorial of a number. if the value of n is 0 then it will return 1. otherwise it initializes result to 1 and multiplies it by i which is from 1 to n



2. Fibonacci Function

#pseudocode

function fibonacci(n)
if(n<=1)
  return n
else
 a=0 and b=1
 for i from 2 to n
    result = a + b
         a = b
         b = result
return result

this function calculates the fibonacci series.if the value of n is 0 or 1 it will return n. otherwise initialise 2 variables a and b with values 0 and 1 respectively. for i from 2 to n calculate the result by adding the current values of a and b. then put the value in a is equal to b and b equals to result to maintain the series


##Modularity:-Modularity involves breaking down your code into smaller, manageable and reusable modules.
